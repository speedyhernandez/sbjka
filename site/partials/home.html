    <h2>About Santa Barbara JKA</h2>
    <img src="img/home-dojo-entrence.jpg" class="photo">
    <p>From 1980 to 1992 <a href="#/instructors#Sensei">Sensei Masayuki Ueoka</a> taught regularly scheduled classes at both the Santa Barbara YMCA and at University of California, Santa Barbara. During this period of time a core group of students grew in number. These students continued to train at the YMCA and assist Sensei Ueoka with teaching in the often very large classes at UCSB. In 1992, this core group, with the agreement of Sensei Ueoka, decided to open a Dojo for regular training, in lieu of teaching through the YMCA.</p>
    <p>Santa Barbara JKA (SBJKA) opened its doors in March of 1992. Sensei Ueoka continued to support UCSB classes and also teach intermediate and advanced classes at the main Dojo. <a href="#/instructors#Paul">Paul Johnson</a> (Sandan, 2011) and others taught beginner and intermediate classes. In 1995, SBJKA discontinued support of classes at UCSB due to the class load at the main Dojo. Today, the same format continues, with a core group of dedicated Karate-Ka training and teaching, and Sensei Ueoka running advanced classes.</p>

    <h3>Why our Dojo?</h3>
    <img src="img/dojo-floor.jpg" class="photo">
    <p>Because you want to train in a hard style of offense and defense. You want workouts to leave you pushed to the limit. You want each and every technique you learn to be completely effective. You want more from martial arts then a belt.</p>
    <p>We are not the biggest school in town. That is a benefit to those that train here. The training is extremely personalized and the instructors are there to teach you. They are not doing this for recognition or profit. They are here because they want to pass on the things that they have learned because what the martial arts has provided them throughout their lives. With over 75 (not sure the actual number) years of combined martial arts experience, they will give you what you need to become something more than you were before you walked though our doors. Our dojo exists because we want to train hard and push each other.</p>
    <p>Our floor is not that large, but its quality is exceptional. Come on and give it a try some time and see for yourself.</p>
