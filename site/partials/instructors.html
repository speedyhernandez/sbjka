Komazawa University was, and still is, renowned for producing powerful karate practitioners, and in 1970 Sensei Ueoka was a team member when Komazawa took the All Japan College Championship. During his time at Komazawa, Sensei Ueoka had the privilege of training under Sensei Hiroshi Shirai, himself a Komazawa graduate and now the head of the European Traditional Karate Federation.
