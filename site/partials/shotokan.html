    <h2>Shotokan Karate</h2>
    <img src="img/original-shotokan-dojo.jpg" class="photo">
    <p>Shotokan was the name of the first official dojo built by Funakoshi, in 1936 at Mejiro, and destroyed in 1945 as a result of allied bombing. Shoto, meaning "pine-waves" (the movement of pine needles when the wind blows through them), was Funakoshi's pen-name, which he used in his poetic and philosophical writings and messages to his students. The Japanese kan means "house" or "hall". In honor of their sensei, Funakoshi's students created a sign reading shoto-kan which was placed above the entrance of the hall where Funakoshi taught. Gichin Funakoshi never gave his style a name, just calling it "karate".</p>
    <h3 id="Founder">Founder Funakoshi Gichin</h3>

    <p>The Father of Modern Karate, Funakoshi Gichin was born on Nov 10, 1868 in Yamakawa, Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture. He was of samurai lineage, from a family which in former times had been vassals of Ryukyu Dynasty nobles.</p>
    <p>By age 11 he had already made a name for himself in Ryukyu-style martial arts. Beginning his training under Master Azato Anko, it wasn't long before he equaled his master in ability, and shared with him the distinction of being the "most accomplished" martial artist in the field. He also learned karate-jutsu (written with characters that mean "Chinese-hand martial art") from Master Itosu Anko. Both his teachers were impressed by his nobility of character.</p>
    <p>As over the years he pursued his training and continuously developed his remarkable skills, Master Funakoshi became chairman of the Okinawa Martial Arts Society, as well as an instructor at the Okinawa Teacher's School.</p>
    <p>Then in 1922, when he was 54 years old, he introduced Okinawan karate-jutsu at the first Ministry of Education (now Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture)-sponsored Physical Education Exhibition. This introduction, the first ever public display of karate-jutsu in Japan, was a stunning success. And the previously unknown martial artist Funakoshi Gichin rose to instant fame throughout the Japanese world of martial arts.</p>
    <p>Immediately the founder of modern judo, Kano Jigoro, invited Master Funakoshi and his pupil Gima Shinkin to the Kodokan judo dojo to give a demonstration of kata. The highly-attended event filled the Kodokan dojo to capacity. It was so well-received that Master Funakoshi found himself pressed on all sides to stay in Tokyo.</p>

    <p>Excited by the opportunity to further promote the martial art that he had done so much to introduce to Japan, Master Funakoshi subsequently began teaching it at Tokyo's Meiseijuku, a dormitory for Okinawan students there. In 1922, he published a book entitled "Ryukyu Kempo Karate." It was the first formal exposition in Japan on the art of karate-jutsu. Not only were its contents fresh and novel, it was also beautifully written, and immediately created an unprecedented karate boom.</p>
    <p>As the popularity of karate-jutsu began to spread, Master Funakoshi produced the first ever "Dan Ranking Certification" in April, 1924.</p>
    <p>Around the same time, with the encouragement of his teacher of Buddhism, Abbot Furukawa Gyodo of Enkakuji Temple in Kamakura, Master Funakoshi started practicing Zen. He contemplated the well-known Buddhist teaching that says "form is emptiness and emptiness is form." He began to see the relevance of that teaching to his martial art, and ultimately changed the characters for karate from kara + te ("Chinese" + "hand") to kara + te ("empty" + "hand").</p>
    <p>Then, in order to popularize the "local" Okinawan martial art in the rest of Japan, Master Funakoshi synthesized a complete system of techniques and theory, and changed the Chinese and Okinawan names of the kata into standard Japanese. In 1929, after much thought and reflection, he also changed the name of karate-jutsu ("Chinese-hand martial art") to karate-do ("the way of karate," or "the way of the empty hand"). He then defined the Twenty Precepts of Karate, and established a grand karate philosophy.</p>

    <p>At last the way of karate had come into its own, and was gaining popularity all across Japan. The number of people wishing to begin training was growing daily-so much so that it became difficult to find a place for them to practice. So in 1939 Master Funakoshi established the "Shotokan" dojo, which he built at his own expense. ("Shoto" was the literary first name he used when doing calligraphy and writing poetry. "Shoto" means "Pine Waves," and refers to the sound of wind blowing through the pines, which resembles the sound of ocean waves.)</p>
    <p>By this time, Master Funakoshi had long been teaching karate to high-school and university students. As a result, karate clubs had sprung up at higher education institutions all over Japan-which is another reason why karate has become as respected as it is today.</p>
    <p>In the air raids of World War II, the Shotokan dojo was destroyed, and the growth of karate came to a halt. But after the war, followers of Funakoshi's way re-grouped, and in 1949 they formed the Japan Karate Association, with Funakoshi Gichin as Supreme Master.</p>
    <p>On April 10, 1957, the Ministry of Education gave official recognition to the JKA, and it became a legal entity. A mere sixteen days later, at the age of 89, Master Funakoshi passed away. A large public memorial service was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan (Ryogoku National Sumo Hall), attended by more than 20,000 people, including many famous names who came to pay their respects.</p>
    <p>A memorial monument to Master Funakoshi was established at Enkakuji Temple in Kamakura. Members of the JKA pay an honorary visit on April 29th each year, the date of the Shoto Festival.</p>
    <h3 id="Master">Master Hidetaka Nishiyama</h3>
    <img src="img/Hidetaka-Nishiyama.jpg" class="photo">
    <p>Japanese-American karate master, author, administrator and pioneer. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Hidetaka Nishiyama began his karate training in 1943 under Gichin Funakoshi at the Shoto-kan. Two years later, while enrolled at Takushoku University, he became a member of the university's karate team, for which in 1949 he was named captain. He was a co-founder of the All Japan Collegiate Karate Federation and was elected its first chairman.</p>
    <p>Nishiyama received a Master of Arts degree in economics from Takushoku University in 1951. That same year, he was a co-founder of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) and was elected to the JKA board of Directors.</p>
    <p>In 1952, he was selected as a member of the martial arts combat instruction staff for the Strategic Air Command (SAC) Combat Training Program. SAC personnel received training in judo, aikido, and karate at the Kodokan. The other karate instructors for this program included Gichin Funakoshi, Masatoshi Nakayama, and lsao Obata. In 1953, SAC invited Nishiyama as part of a 10-member Budo Mission from Japan. The team visited SAC bases in the U.S. for three months giving instruction in karate, judo, and aikido.</p>
    <p>Karate: The Art of Empty-Hand Fighting co-written with Nishiyama and published in 1960, is even today considered the definitive text book on the subject. In its 70th printing, (2,000 copies per printing) it is believed to be the best selling karate text book in history.</p>
    <p>In July 1961, SAC karate students and JKA members residing in the United States invited Nishiyama to visit America. Later that year, he organized the All American Karate Federation (AAKF) as a nationally based amateur karate organization. In November of the same year, Nishiyama organized under the control of the AAKF the first National Karate Championship in Los Angeles, California where he also established his dojo. Since then Nishiyama has been a major force in the propagation of the Shotokan style of karate in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
    <p>In 1965, Nishiyama organized a committee with the cooperation of the major Japanese karate styles that led to the first United States vs. Japan Goodwill Karate Tournament. Because of the participation of the All Japan Collegiate Karate Team, this event became the first truly international karate competition.</p>
    <img src="img/Hidetaka-Nishiyama-2.jpg" class="photo alt-view">
    <p>In 1968, Nishiyama organized the first World Invitational Karate Tournament held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in conjunction with the Olympic Commemorative Tournament hosted by the Mexico Karate Federation in Mexico City. A conference which took place during the tournament culminated in an agreement to form an international karate organization and to hold its first World Championship in Tokyo. In 1970, during a reorganization of the AAKF as the traditional karate governing body, the JKA Karate group separated and became the JKA-US, part of the AAKF.</p>
    <p>Nishiyama continued as Chairman of the JKA-US and also as Chairman of the AAKF. In April of that same year, the AAKF became a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee. In 1973, Nishiyama co-founded the Pan American Karate Union (PAKU) and was elected its First Executive Director. The first PAKU Championship was staged in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
    <p>Based on a 1968 agreement formed at a Mexico City conference, tournaments were held in Tokyo (1970) and Paris (1973).These World Championships resulted in disagreements caused by the lack of formal international organization. An international meeting later followed in New York City resulting in the formation of the International Amateur Karate Federation (IAKF) with Nishiyama elected as its Executive Director. The first IAKF World Championship was held in Los Angeles in 1975.</p>
    <p>He oversaw the formation of the Mediterranean Kara te Championship Committee and Bolivian Karate Federation in 1976. Also that year, acting on behalf of the IAKF, he submitted an application to the International Olympic Committee seeking Olympic recognition for Karate.</p>
    <p>Nishiyama then supported the formation in 1977 of the Central America/Caribbean Karate Confederation and the Asia/Oceania Amateur Karate Federation. In 1979, in accordance with U.S. Public Law regulating national amateur sports governing bodies, the All American Karate Federation was succeeded by the American Amateur Karate Federation, a public benefit, non-profit corporation. Nishiyama was elected its first President.</p>
    <p>In 1981, he also lent support to the formation of the South American Karate Confederation and the North American Karate Confederation.</p>
    <p>In 1985, the IAKF changed its name to the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) because the word "karate" had become a generic term applied to a variety of kicking/punching sports. The ITKF, under Nishiyama's direction, wanted to make clear it was the governing body of traditional karate. In 1987, the IOC officially confirmed that the ITKF was the governing body for traditional karate.</p>

    <p>Nishiyama's reputation has spread foremost because of his superior technical expertise and his disciplined instruction.</p>
    <p>Among his former students are All Japan Karate Champions Hiroshi Shirai and Takeshi Oishi. He trained a host of international and national instructors, national champions and celebrities.</p>
    <p>After 56 years of living the life of Shotokan Karate, Master Hidetaka Nishiyama passed away on November 7th, 2008, at the age of 80.</p>
